FIRST group meeting at scilife lab to discuss and plan about our project. General outline about the project, 
tools that are to be used in this project (hardklör for mass selection, crux/tide for database search and peptide/protein matching, 
percolator for improving matches and MODa to search for post translational modifications if any) were discussed briefly and the literature
was collected about them. Divided the tools among ourselves to study but each of us must be aware of using all the tools. Finally, we had 
a draft of our project plan, description.

DATE: 30-11-2017
Presented a short presentation about our project to our peers and teachers.

DATE: 1-12-2017 to 3-12-2017
Browsed papers about the software tools. Run online tutorial datasets.

SECOND GROUP MEETING at scilife lab.

Dari explained about our data files format (dta files) and how they should be converted into mzML or mzXML as these formats are 
preferred while dealing with MS data. We used open MS software (the file converter) to convert our data files into mzML and mzXML
in order to run hardklör.
•	We started with running hardklör by downloading it. 
•	Initially we ran hardklör with provided configuration file which caused ‘invalid output file’ error. But, we fixed it by running 
hardklör with command line approach.
•	But now we faced ‘input file missing spectral data’ error. We dint understand the exact problem. We removed optimisation flag and 
added debugging flag.
•	Then we used GNU debugger (GDB) to solve, but it did not help. 
•	We tried using MGF format by converting dta files to MGF. We also tried to run hardklör on windows version but ended up with same error. 
•	Then we realised that Hardklör algorithm is already implemented in the Crux through Bullseye, so we decided to work with crux. 
•	We noticed that crux need MS1 and MS2 file formats as input. So, we went back to OpenMS and tried to export a MS1 file from the 
dta-file. But we failed even after multiple attempts. 
•	We assumed that the problem might be because of missing spectra files.
•	So, we contacted KI and requested for raw data. They sent us an mzML file.
•	Finally, we extracted MS1 and MS2 files using Open MS/MS file converter.
•	Then we used Crux tide index (created index using FASTA file from Cambridge data) and ran crux tide search.
