FIRST group meeting at scilife lab to discuss and plan about our project. General outline about the project, 
tools that are to be used in this project (hardklör for mass selection, crux/tide for database search and peptide/protein matching, 
percolator for improving matches and MODa to search for post translational modifications if any) were discussed briefly and the literature
was collected about them. Divided the tools among ourselves to study but each of us must be aware of using all the tools. Finally, we had 
a draft of our project plan, description.
